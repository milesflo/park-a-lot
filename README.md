#Park-A-Lot

A lightweight parking garage locator using AngularJS, Google Maps, and the Parking Whiz API

##How to use:
1.) Type/c&p an address into the search bar.

2.) Choose a search radius from the selector.

3.) Press 'Submit'.

4.) Scroll down in the sidebar to view results. 

5.) Hover over garage name to make that garage's marker bounce.

####Suggested changes
I showed this app to a couple of friends to play around with. Here are my notes on their feedback.

1.) Fix Places Library for Google Maps. Make it so that you can look up locations AND addresses.

2.) Inital search radius value.

3.) Change Park WHiz API to take Lag/Lng instead of address because better UX

3a.) ** Be able to drop a pin and search around that.

4.) set min-width on search field (or higher page minwidth)

5.) Update the UI. Still looks "hella old looking"

6.) Make the list prettier. Get some nicer fonts or somethin.

7.) Marker animations are still kinda buggy. They should loop until the mouse moves away.

8.) GOOGLE MAPS DIRECTIONS!! Be able to drive from your house, to the garage, then walk to target location.
